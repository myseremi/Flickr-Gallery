The user will be able to see the latest uploads on the main page before they search for specific pictures using the search bar. The user will be able to see pictures and their title's individually by clicking on them. Infinite scroll is available. 

## How to start

In the project folder, type:
```
npm start
```
Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/

## Sources
- [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/): used to access the photo library
- [Flickr Photo Library with AngularJS](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/blogs/flicker-photo-library-using-with-angularjs): used as a guide

### Libraries
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): Bootstrap is a front-end open source toolkit, used mainly for responsive design. I decided to include it in the project to help speed up layout design. 
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/): It is a framework used for creating dynamic web apps. As I was not very familiar with the framework, and since it is a standard in the company, I decided to further develop my skills. It was challenging, but I gave it my best.
